###BOUNCING BALL GAME
  ##USING OBJECTIVE POINTS FROM https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pygame-tutorial-build-a-bouncing-game/

  ##PLATFORM MOVEMENT
    #MOVE LEFT AND RIGHT FROM KEYS
    #CANT MOVE OFF SCREEN
  
  ##BALL BOUNCE
    #BALL BOUNCE OFF WALL AND PLATFORM
    #POINT INCREASE WHEN BOUNCE OFF PLATFORM
  
  ##SCORE SYSTEM
    #SCORE INCREASES AFTER BOUNCE OFF PLATFORM

##-------------------------------------------------------##

###POTENTIAL OTHERS
  ##LEVELS
  ##DYNAMIC PLATFORM COLOUR
  ##LIVES AND GAME OVER
    #RESPAWN BALL LIMITED NUMBER OF TIMES
    #GAME OVER AFTER THAT MANY TIMES
    #RESET SCORE AFTER GAME OVER
